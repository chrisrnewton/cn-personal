After implementing product-led growth strategies at Klaviyo, Ketch, and Skedda—driving thousands of signups and millions in pipeline—I've learned what actually works in B2B PLG. Here's the playbook.

## What is Product-Led Growth?

PLG is a go-to-market strategy where the product itself drives acquisition, conversion, and expansion. Instead of relying solely on sales teams, you let users experience value before talking to anyone.

**Traditional Sales-Led:** Marketing → SDR → AE → Customer

**Product-Led:** User Signs Up → Experiences Value → Converts (with or without sales)

## The PLG Funnel That Works

### 1. Frictionless Signup

Remove every barrier to getting started:

- **No credit card required** for free trials
- **Single sign-on options** (Google, Microsoft)
- **Minimal form fields** - just email to start
- **Instant access** - no "we'll get back to you"

At Skedda, we drove 6,000+ signups in 6 months by making signup take less than 30 seconds.

### 2. Time-to-Value Optimization

The faster users see value, the more likely they convert. Map out your "aha moment" and remove every step between signup and that moment.

**Questions to ask:**
- What's the single action that makes users say "this is useful"?
- How many steps does it take to get there?
- What can you pre-populate or automate?

### 3. Self-Serve Onboarding

Build onboarding that doesn't require human intervention:

- **Interactive product tours** (not just videos)
- **Contextual tooltips** that appear when needed
- **Progress indicators** showing setup completion
- **Template libraries** so users don't start from scratch

### 4. Usage-Based Conversion Triggers

Not everyone converts at the same time. Set up triggers based on product usage:

- User hits usage limit → upgrade prompt
- User invites team members → team plan offer
- User uses advanced feature → premium upsell
- User inactive for 7 days → re-engagement email

## PLG Metrics That Matter

Forget vanity metrics. Track these:

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Signup → Activation Rate** | Is onboarding working? |
| **Time to Value** | How fast do users see results? |
| **Free → Paid Conversion** | Is the product selling itself? |
| **Expansion Revenue** | Are users growing with you? |
| **Product Qualified Leads (PQLs)** | Who's ready for sales? |

## Combining PLG with Sales

PLG doesn't mean no sales team. It means a more efficient one.

**Product Qualified Leads (PQLs):** Users who hit engagement thresholds that indicate buying intent. These convert 5-10x better than MQLs.

**PQL Criteria Examples:**
- Invited 3+ team members
- Used product 5+ days in a row
- Hit 80% of usage limit
- Viewed pricing page 3+ times

At Ketch, we 20x'd free signups while also quadrupling demo requests. PLG and sales-led aren't mutually exclusive.

## Common PLG Mistakes

**1. No clear upgrade path**
Users don't know how to pay you. Make pricing obvious and upgrade frictionless.

**2. Ignoring free users**
Free users are future customers and referral sources. Nurture them.

**3. Too much friction "for security"**
Every form field, verification step, and approval process kills conversion.

**4. Not tracking product usage**
You can't optimize what you don't measure. Implement product analytics from day one.

**5. Waiting too long to add sales**
Pure PLG works for some products. Most B2B needs sales assist for larger deals.

## Getting Started with PLG

If you're transitioning from sales-led to PLG:

1. **Start with a free tier or trial** - even if limited
2. **Implement product analytics** (Heap, Amplitude, Mixpanel)
3. **Define your activation metric** - what action predicts conversion?
4. **Build self-serve onboarding** - reduce dependency on humans
5. **Create PQL criteria** - when should sales engage?

PLG isn't a switch you flip. It's a muscle you build over time. Start small, measure everything, and iterate.
