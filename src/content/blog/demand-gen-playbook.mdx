I've built and scaled demand gen programs at companies from Series A to growth stage, generating over $10M in pipeline and $3M+ in closed-won revenue. This is the playbook I use.

## The Demand Gen Framework

Effective B2B demand generation has three layers:

1. **Capture Demand** - People actively searching for solutions
2. **Create Demand** - People who don't know they have a problem yet
3. **Convert Demand** - Turning interest into pipeline

Most companies only do #1 and wonder why growth stalls.

## Layer 1: Capture Existing Demand

These are high-intent buyers actively searching. Capture them first.

### Paid Search (Google Ads)

**What works:**
- Brand terms (protect your name)
- Competitor terms (capture comparison shoppers)
- High-intent keywords ("best [category] software", "[competitor] alternative")
- Bottom-funnel terms ("[product type] pricing", "[category] demo")

**Pro tip:** Start with exact match keywords, expand to phrase match once you have conversion data.

### SEO for Bottom-Funnel

Create pages targeting buyers ready to purchase:

- **Comparison pages:** "Your Product vs. Competitor"
- **Alternative pages:** "Best [Competitor] Alternatives"
- **Category pages:** "Best [Category] Software 2024"
- **Integration pages:** "[Your Product] + [Popular Tool] Integration"

At Skedda, our competitive alternative pages generated 5+ customers and $1,000+ MRR in the first 3 months.

### Review Sites & Directories

Be present where buyers research:

- G2, Capterra, TrustRadius (B2B software)
- Industry-specific directories
- Respond to every review (good and bad)

## Layer 2: Create New Demand

Most of your market isn't actively searching. You need to create awareness and interest.

### Content Marketing

**Content that generates demand:**

| Content Type | Purpose | Metric |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Blog posts | SEO + education | Organic traffic |
| Ebooks/guides | Lead capture | Downloads |
| Webinars | Education + leads | Registrations |
| Case studies | Social proof | Influence on deals |
| Tools/calculators | Interactive value | Leads + backlinks |

At Skedda, we launched a hybrid-work grader tool that generated 50+ leads in the first month.

### Paid Social

LinkedIn and Meta for B2B awareness:

**LinkedIn:**
- Thought leadership ads (promote best content)
- Lead gen forms (higher conversion than landing pages)
- Retargeting website visitors

**Meta:**
- Lookalike audiences based on customers
- Video content for awareness
- Retargeting with case studies

### Email Nurture

Not everyone converts immediately. Build nurture sequences:

- **Welcome series** (days 1-7): Product education
- **Value series** (weeks 2-4): Use cases, case studies
- **Conversion series** (weeks 4+): Demos, trials, offers

## Layer 3: Convert Demand to Pipeline

Getting attention is useless without conversion.

### Landing Page Optimization

Every campaign needs a dedicated landing page:

- **One CTA** per page (don't confuse visitors)
- **Social proof** above the fold
- **Benefit-focused headlines** (not feature-focused)
- **Form length** matched to offer value

A/B test continuously. At Teikametrics, always-on testing improved conversion rates by 5-10%.

### Lead Scoring

Not all leads are equal. Score based on:

**Demographic fit:**
- Company size
- Industry
- Job title
- Geography

**Behavioral signals:**
- Pages viewed (pricing = high intent)
- Content downloaded
- Email engagement
- Product usage (if PLG)

### Sales Handoff

Define clear handoff criteria:

- **MQL:** Marketing Qualified Lead (fits ICP + engaged)
- **SQL:** Sales Qualified Lead (budget, authority, need, timeline)
- **PQL:** Product Qualified Lead (usage-based qualification)

At Ketch, proper lead scoring helped us lower Cost-per-Opportunity by 75%.

## The Metrics Dashboard

Track these weekly:

### Volume Metrics
- Leads by source
- MQLs generated
- SQLs generated
- Pipeline created
- Closed-won revenue

### Efficiency Metrics
- Cost per Lead (CPL)
- Cost per MQL
- Cost per Opportunity
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Marketing-sourced revenue %

### Conversion Metrics
- Lead → MQL rate
- MQL → SQL rate
- SQL → Opportunity rate
- Opportunity → Closed rate

## Budget Allocation

For a $2M annual budget (like I managed at Ketch):

| Channel | % of Budget | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Paid Search | 30% | Capture demand |
| Paid Social | 25% | Create demand |
| Content/SEO | 20% | Long-term growth |
| Events/Sponsorships | 15% | Brand + leads |
| Tools/Tech | 10% | Infrastructure |

Adjust based on what's working. Double down on winners, cut losers quickly.

## Common Demand Gen Mistakes

1. **No attribution tracking** - You can't optimize what you don't measure
2. **Spreading budget too thin** - Better to own 2 channels than dabble in 10
3. **Ignoring the funnel** - Only focusing on top or bottom
4. **No sales alignment** - Marketing and sales must agree on definitions
5. **Giving up too early** - Most channels take 3-6 months to optimize

## Getting Started

If you're building demand gen from scratch:

**Month 1:** Set up tracking, launch paid search for high-intent terms
**Month 2:** Build landing pages, start content production
**Month 3:** Launch paid social, implement lead scoring
**Month 4-6:** Optimize, scale what works, cut what doesn't

Demand gen is a system, not a campaign. Build the machine, then feed it.
